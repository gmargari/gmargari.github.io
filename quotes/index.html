In fact, the interstate highways in Sport Utility Vehicle Commercial World, having been abandoned by humans, are teeming with deer, squirrels, birds, and other wildlife species that have fled from the forests to avoid being run over by nature-seekers in multi-ton vehicles barreling through the underbrush at 50 miles per hour." data-link-to="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gmargari/bing-translated-quotes/master//images/quote-745.jpg"></a></li>
